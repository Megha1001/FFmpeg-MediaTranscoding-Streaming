Input --> ffmpeg --> output


	Transcoding
	-------------
	Input --> Unpack --> Uncompress --> Compress --> Pack --> Output

	Unpack --> aka Demux --> decoupling audio and video
	Uncompress --> aka Decode --> converting into orignal format
	compress --> aka Encode
	Pack --> aka Mux

	But besies just simply going from one format to another, as show above, ffmpeg can also modify the video and audio in other ways, for example , by scaling the video or amplying the audio it does this by help of filter


	Transcoding and Filters
	-------------------------
	Input --> Unpack --> Uncompress --> Filter1 --> Filter2 --> Filter3 --> Compress --> Pack --> Output
