Fundamentals of Media
----------------------

Media is broad term that can be use either for image OR audio OR video

Image
	 Pixel
	  - Smallest representation of a point in 2D space
	  - Building block of an image
	  - Has a color - represented by RGB or YUV
	  - Can have transparency information(alpha)

	 Image 
	  - is a collection of pixel
	  - Rectangle
	  - has width and height

	Image Resolution
		- Represents quality
		- Denoted as width * height
		- Examples : HD(1920 * 1080), UHD(3840 * 2160), 4K(4096 *2160)

	Image aspect ration
		- Ratio of width and height
		- Examples : 16:9, 4:3

Audio
	Audio Sample
		- Smallest digital representation of a sound
		- Building block of an audio
		- Can be stored as 8/16/24/32 bit value(bit depth)
		- More bits => higher quality audio

	Audio Frequency
		- How many samples per second
		- Examples : 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz
		- Higher Frequency => higher quality

	Audio
		- Sequence of samples played together
		- Has a time duration

	Audio channels
		- Represents a sequence of samples
		- Channels of the same audio track are meant to be played together
		- Channels can be organized in "channel layouts"
			- Mono - a single point of sound
			- Stereo - like headset - one left and one right
			-  5.1 & 7.1 - surround sound

	Audio track : 
		- Organize different sounds that relate to the same timeline.
		- it represents a collection of channels that can be multiple audio tracks within a single audio file.
		- Different audio tracks are used to organize different sounds that relates to the same timeline.
		- The tracks may or may not be intended to be used together, for example , a documentry media file can have english track and hindi track but not meant to be played together but can mix with background track.

Video
	- Sequence of images
	- Has time duration
	- Each image is called as frame.

	Video frame Rate(FPS)
		Frame per second

	Video compression
		- Works by removing redundat information
		- Spatial redundancy - within a frame
			This means that the nearby pixels of an area on the tree frame do not very much and therefore can be encoded efficiently using fewer bits without losing significant quality.
			The same technique is used for individual image file compression as well
		- Temporal redundancy - accross the frame
